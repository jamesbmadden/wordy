# Wordy

An app assisting language learning by helping you to learn words, taking advantage of the Wiktionary API.

## Running

With flutter installed, either use the CLI or extensions in an IDE like VS Code to select your target platform and run the app. It has been officially tested on Windows and Android, with web support planned, but should be compatible with iOS, MacOS, and Linux as well.
