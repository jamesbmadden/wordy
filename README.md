# Wordy

An app assisting language learning by helping you to learn words, taking advantage of the Wiktionary API.

## Running

With flutter installed, either use the CLI or extensions in an IDE like VS Code to select your target platform and run the app. It has been officially tested on Windows and Android, with web support planned, but should be compatible with iOS, MacOS, and Linux as well.

## Plan

MVP Features:
- Load in words with their translations and pronunciations if available from wiktionary
- Quiz on words

Future Planned Features:
- Compute most common words from wikipedia translations and use auto add those to learn
- Text-To-Speech for pronunciation using IPA text-to-speech model
- Account for data syncing across devices (using Firebase?)
